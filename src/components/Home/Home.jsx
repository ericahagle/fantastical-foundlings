            Is it lonely in the back of the cart traveling from city to city looking for work? Are your arcane studies progressing to the point where you can control a familiar? Or maybe you've been at this game for so long that you're recently had to retire an old familiar, friend, or companion.

            You're neither royalty nor made of coin, and you know full well not to listen to the hucksters peddling magical kitties in the back alleys of the local port town. And by now, we all know not to purchase a baby dragon from a shop. So give us a look, here at the Fantastical Foundlings rescue, where we re-home everything from the most special little magical babies to the most mammoth countryside-burning critters. Good, bad, non-committal, cats â€¦ we have them all and they all have the same thing in common: They are ready to set out on their next big adventure with you.
